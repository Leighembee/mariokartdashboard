# Welcome to Mario Kart All(oy) Stars
This is the very begining of a fun project using data collected from Mario Kart 64 Games!

## To Dos:
* add data for the characters and tracks that pop up in the modals
* make responsive for mobile and smaller screens
* build out the backend with api/db for data and to store assets ( probably mySQL ) 
* add ability to add new game data
* logins / authentication
* another page just for track history data 
* add redux
* re organize folder structure ( containers / components etc )

The app is currently deployed at https://mariokartalloystars.herokuapp.com/
